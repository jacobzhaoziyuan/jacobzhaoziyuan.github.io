Welcome to Ziyuan (Jacob) ZHAO's homepage (ËµµÂ≠êÊ∫ê)


I am currently a senior research engineer at
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r">Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R)</a>, 
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/">Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)</a>, Singapore üá∏üá¨. I am also a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the 
<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse">School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE)</a>,
<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/">Nanyang Technological Unversity (NTU)</a>, 
supervised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/ctguan/">Prof. Cuntai Guan</a>.
Previously, I received the M.Tech degree, <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> in 2019 
and the B.Eng degree, <a href="http://english.ynu.edu.cn/">Yunnan University</a> in 2017.

My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary field of biomedical image analysis, artificial intelligence and healthcare.
I am dedicated to designing machine learning algorithms for biomedical image analysis and automatic medical diagnosis, promoting wider AI-powered healthcare in the real world.
Specifically, I focus on (1) developing annotation-efficient learning algorithms to minimize the annotation cost; (2) developing cross-domain learning algorithms to integrate different biomedical data; and (3) building reliable, generalizable, and practical AI healthcare systems from imperfect biomedical data. I have published more than 30 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2vL2XTsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fjacobzhaoziyuan%2Fjacobzhaoziyuan.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences and journals.
